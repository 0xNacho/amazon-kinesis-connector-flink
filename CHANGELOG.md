## Release 1.1.0 (December 22nd, 2020)
* Migrate EFO consumers to use `DescribeStreamSummary` rather than `DescribeStream`. `DescribeStreamSummary` has a 
higher TPS quota, resulting in reduced startup time for high parallelism sources. You may need add IAM permission for 
`kinesis:DescribeStreamSummary` while upgrading to this version 
 ([pull request](https://github.com/awslabs/amazon-kinesis-connector-flink/pull/10))

  [issue](https://github.com/awslabs/amazon-kinesis-connector-flink/issues/9))

* Fix issue when Polling consumer using timestamp with empty shard
  ([pull request](https://github.com/awslabs/amazon-kinesis-connector-flink/pull/6))

* Optimise `ShardConsumer` to clone `DersializationSchema` once per object rather than once per record
  ([pull request](https://github.com/awslabs/amazon-kinesis-connector-flink/pull/5))

## Release 1.0.2 (October 30th, 2020)
* Ignore `ReadTimeoutException` from `SubcribeToShard` retry policy to prevent app restarting due to high backpressure
  ([pull request](https://github.com/awslabs/amazon-kinesis-connector-flink/pull/3))
  
* Optimise error handling. Introduced a separate error delivery mechanism to improve performance under high backpressure
  ([pull request](https://github.com/awslabs/amazon-kinesis-connector-flink/pull/4))
